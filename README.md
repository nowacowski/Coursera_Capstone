Applied Data Science Capstone

This repo was created as part of the Coursera Applied Data Science Capstone course. 
The final project was to come up with a data science problem and solve it in the topic area of 'The Battle of Neighbourhoods'.

The project I created:

### "Best areas to stay at while visitng Istanbul"
Gathers and analyses data related to accomodation prices, safety and locations, distances and ratings of top sightseeing attractions and eateries in Istanbul. Based on that classification of the districts is made using Kmeans clustering. Finally, based on the results most optimal districts to stay in Istanbul are determined.
