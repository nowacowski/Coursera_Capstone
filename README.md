Applied Data Science Capstone

This repo was created as part of the Coursera Applied Data Science Capstone course. 
The final project was to come up with a data science problem and solve it in the topic area of 'The Battle of Neighbourhoods'.

The project created:

### "Best areas to stay at while visitng Istanbul"
Gathers and analyses data related to **accomodation prices**, **safety** and locations, distances and ratings of **top sightseeing attractions and eateries** in Istanbul. Based on that classification of districts is made using Kmeans clustering. Finally, based on the results most optimal districts to stay in Istanbul are determined.
